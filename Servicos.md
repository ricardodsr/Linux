            LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
            ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
            SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

            33 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
            To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
